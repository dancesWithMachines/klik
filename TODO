Before release:
    * Add license
    * Add manual
    * Add necessary license files
    * Add readme
    * Correct versioning in CMakeLists.txt
    * Move repo from local to github

Improvements:
    * Replace some of the "Init" functions with "Setup"
    * Add dynamic recount for content length in request

Ideas:
    * Add config args to cmake, similar to how it's done in pico-examples (for pico w)
